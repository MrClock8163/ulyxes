Introduction
############

Ulyxes is an open source project to drive Robotic Total Stations (RTS) and
other location aware sensors and publish observation results on web based maps 
(GPL 2). The name of Ulyxes come from the Greek Odysseus who was a legendary
Greek king of Ithaca island. Or it can be resolved as Ultimate Y X Estimation
System.

The first aim of the project is to create a framework to drive different 
location aware sensors from a computer, furthermore publish the data on the
Internet. The project is based on several open source projects and programming
languages. The overview of the system can been seen on the following figure:

System Divisions
################

Publisher Interface
*******************

The first part of the system is the publishing interface where the measurement
results and the related analysis are published in the form of maps, tables and 
graphs with the associated Geo-spatial visualization. The interface works within
an Internet browser (e.g. Mozzila Firefox or Google Chrome) which supports to
run Javascript. As for operation system, the interface is cross-platform so it
can be used on any operation system.

Servers
*******

There are number of open source server projects contribute the back-end
operation of the system. In order to store the observation data in databases,
Ulyxes uses PostgreSQL/PostGIS object relational database. The data flow from 
the database to the web-server is solved by using PHP scriptins or MapServer. 
The webserver is driven and supported by the Apache Web Server. In addition, 
other possibilities and alternatives can be used to solve the server side works,
for example a Map Server (Web Map Service - WMS) can be also an effective 
solution.


Sensor Managers
***************

The system contains two different API independent from each other: the 
**TclAPI** and the **PyAPI**. The TclAPI is the old and its development is 
finished (depricated). Tha PyAPI is the new and actively developed.

TclAPI (depricated)
===================

The TclAPI consist of a couple of Tcl (Tool Command Language) files/procs which
give a higher level interface to drive RTSs and GPSs from computer. The TclAPI 
is released under GNU GPL V2.0. This API is obsolate and no new functionality
will be added. It has been already tested with the following type of
instruments:

    * Leica TCA1800 
    * Leica TPS120x
    * Leica TPS110x 
    * Leica DNA03 
    * Trimble 550x 
    * Garmin GPS18 
    * Leica GPS 500

PyAPI
=====

First of all the TclAPI is only able to control total stations and GPSs. The
usage of such instruments does not raise controversies, however other sensors
(i.e. web-cameras or Miro-Electro-Mechanical (MEMS) Sensors) can be also 
effectively used for certain motion monitoring tasks. Furthermore, as for the 
long term tasks the changes of the atmosphere influence our measurements, 
therefore meteorological sensors should be used to determine the meteorological 
elements which with the total stations can be maintained. To easily integrate 
such a different kind of instruments to the system, we decided to rethink our 
system so the PyAPI was created which is based on Python object oriental
language (OOP). Python is a general purpose high-level programming language
that provides a very fast development and testing tools for the user. It has 
countless additional library which can significantly contribute and help the 
programmers' work. Last but not least the biggest commercial and open source 
applications (QGIS, ArcGIS) have selected Python for development tool. (For 
more info, visit https://www.python.org/)

PyAPI is an Application Programming Interface (API) provides several classes to
handle different sensors e.g. Totalstations, NMEA GNSS receivers, MEMS sensors,
web-cameras. The API still only has a beta version.

    Sensor Abstraction

|

*There are three groups of modules used by PyAPI:*

PyAPI Object-Model modules
**************************

The first group consist of modules which build up the logical model between sensors, interfaces and the writer.

Independent modules
*******************

angle.py
========

This module stands for storing angle value of numbers in radian internally. Using this class the angle conversions can be easily done. 

|

Supported angle units:

    * RAD  radians (e.g. 1.54678432)
    * DMS sexagesimal (Degree-Minit-Second, e.g. 123-54-24)
    * DEG decimal degree (e.g. 25.87659)
    * GON gradian whole circle is 400g (e.g. 387.7857)
    * NMEA ddmm.mmmm used in NMEA sentences (e.g. 47.338765)
    * PDEG pseudo sexagesimal (e.g. 156.2745 = 156-27-45)
    * SEC sexagesimal seconds
    * MIL mills the whole circle is 6400 mills

|

.. code:: python

    #Create Angle object with the given value and unit
    a1 = Angle("152-23-45", "DMS")
    #Convert a1 "angle" object to supported units
    for u in ['RAD', 'DMS', 'GON', 'NMEA', 'DEG', 'PDEG', 'MIL']:
        print (a1.GetAngle(u))


Readers
=======

reader.py is the base class for all readers (virtual).

filereader.py
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Class to read file. It is mostly used as a base class for other readers
loading information from file.

.. code:: python
    
    # create a filereader object
    fr = FileReader('test', 'test.txt')
    # print the lines
    print (fr.GetLine())

csvreader.py
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Class to read csv file, first line must contain field names.
Default separator is semicolon (;).

.. code:: python

    # create a csvreader object
    cr = CsvReader('test', 'test.csv')
    # load the whole file into a list
    lines = cr.Load()

georeader.py
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Class to read GeoEasy geo and coo files.


External Python modules
***********************

Logging
=======
This module defines functions and classes which implement a flexible event logging system for applications and libraries.

For more information, please visit the `official Logging documentation <https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html>`_.

Pyusb
=====
The PyUSB module provides for Python easy access to the host machine's Universal Serial Bus (USB) system.

For more information, please visit the `official PyUSB Github page <https://github.com/walac/pyusb>`_.

Cv2/cv (OpenCV)
===============
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library: http://opencv.org) is an open-source BSD-licensed library that includes several hundreds of computer vision algorithms.

For more information, please visit the `official OpenCV documentation <http://docs.opencv.org/modules/core/doc/intro.html>`_.


PyAPI Tutorials
###############

Most of the Python modules contain a unit test part at the end (after
the if __name__ == "__main__":). These are also usage examples.

Use the SerialInterface
***********************

The SearialIface class can be used alone to drive an instrument through the
serial chanel or as a building block of an Instrument instance.

.. code:: python

    from serialiface import SerialIface
    si = SerialIface('test', 'COM1')
    si.Send('%R1Q,9028:0,0,0')
    %R1P,0,0:

Sensor Creation
***************

All the sensors (instruments) are inherited from the Instrument virtual base 
class. A sensor consists of three building blocks:

* measure unit
* interface (communication)
* writer (saving observed data), optional

.. code:: python

    from leicatps1200 import LeicaTPS1200
    from leicatcra1100 import LeicaTCRA1100
    from serialiface import SerialIface
    from echowriter import EchoWriter
    logging.getLogger().setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
    mu = LeicaTPS1200()
    iface = SerialIface("rs-232", "/dev/ttyUSB0")
    wrt = EchoWriter()
    ts = TotalStation("Leica", mu, iface, wrt)
    ts.SetEDMMode(ts.measureUnit.edmModes['RLSTANDARD'])
    ts.Move(Angle(90, 'DEG'), Angle(85, 'DEG'))
    ts.Measure()
    print (ts.GetMeasure())

Monitoring
**********

This block consist of several apps to solve simple tasks for monitoring.

- *FileMaker* creates an input file for monitoring using manual targeting
- *FileGen* creates an input file for monitoring from coordinates automaticly
- *Blindorientation* search for a prism from a known station az calculate orientation
- *Robot* makes automatic observation using a file from FileMaker or FileGen
- *Robotplus* complex monitoring application using FileGen, Blindorientation and Robot

FileMaker
=========

It is a simple interactive app to create input file for monitoring observations.
First set up the total station on a known point and set the orientation.

Usage: filemaker.py output_file [sensor] [serial_port]

Start the application. Two types of output files can be generated, CSV dump 
(.dmp) or GeoEasy (.geo) file.
First it will prompt for the id of the station and the station coordinates.

For each target points the id and mode must be entered.

Target modes:

- ATR*n* use automatic targeting, n is prism type id (1/2/3/...)
- PR*n* prism with manual targeting
- RL reflectorless distance with manual targeting
- RLA automatic reflectorless ditance measurement to given direction
- OR orientation direction, manual targeting, no distance

.. NOTE::
   Generated output file cannot be used for Blindorientation because
   distance missing!
